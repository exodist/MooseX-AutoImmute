NAME
    MooseX::AutoImmute - Use Moose with make_immutable called for you.

DESCRIPTION
    Moose classes are littered with __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable(); at
    the end. This is much like all packages ending with a true value. true
    removes the boilerplate for packages, this removes the boilerplate for
    Moose.

        use MooseX::AutoImmute;

        has ...;

        ...;

        #EOF
        # immutable autamatically!

        package MyPackage;
        use strict;
